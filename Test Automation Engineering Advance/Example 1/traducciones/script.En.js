      "question": "You have been asked to develop test automation for a system that has no documented requirements or existing test cases. You have access to the system's business users. How could test automation be used to help you determine what you need to automate?",
      options: [
        "a. Business users could use the record/playback capability to record what they do, and then you could use those recordings as examples to develop maintainable test automation code.",
        "b. You could use the tools to prepare test data for users.",
        "c. A test automation script could be used to set up the test environment.",
        "d. Developers could use the TAS to define their solution and could implement their code in the TAF, which would allow you to develop the test automation solution from the SUT source code."
      ],
      correctAnswer: 0, // The correct option is a)

      "question": "You are rewriting a TAS to adapt to changes made in the SUT. You have found that the test automation engineer who wrote most of the test scripts used a record/playback tool to find all user interface components on each page to be tested. Objects were referenced directly from the scripts that used the components. You noticed this problem when you needed to update the test automation scripts because the 'gender' radio buttons had to be changed to a dropdown list. This required changes on multiple pages for this web application. Which design approach should the previous test automation engineer have used to make this code more maintainable?",
      options: [
        "a. Flow model pattern",
        "b. Page object pattern",
        "c. SOLID principles",

This has significantly helped the maintenance effort, but you are still spending time fixing scripts that cover common user transactions such as login and view account balance.
