Information must be presented to the requester within three seconds of the request, particularly for patients with critical allergies and pre-existing conditions. You have a technical team that is performing performance tests and is comfortable programming performance test scripts for reuse and maintainability. You are now looking for a tool to use in these tests. You have found one that is compatible with your environment and will be able to generate load through the protocols in use. The team has reviewed it and is comfortable that they can code in the tool and create their scripts with little training. Because there are many stakeholders in these tests, you have verified that the tool provides excellent monitoring and reporting capabilities. You have verified with the various system administrators that they are comfortable with the tool and happy to use its monitoring capabilities in addition to their own tools during testing. What do you still need to verify before selecting this tool?",
